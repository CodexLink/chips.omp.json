## Leftout Features

The following are some of the features that I cut off **_for now_**, due to me, not using it, or has no other ways for me to test it.

- SSH Session Detection [0]
- Other Programming Language Detection [1]
- Battery Indicator [2]

* [0] I can easily invoke this in the Root Indicator Segment, but I have no device that can test it.
* [1] I don't have other programming languages, and for now, I'm planning to add Rust and Flutter. Let me know if other's really needs it.
* [2] As a Laptop User, I would want this one, but does not feel to be fitting for any parts of the segment. I will let this one off for now and will think of it again once I'm done with other things.
